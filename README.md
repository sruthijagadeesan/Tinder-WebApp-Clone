# Tinder-WebApp-Clone

<ul>
<li>This is a basic clone of the Tinder Application.
<li>I've used Reactjs and Material-UI for the overall frontend.
<li>I've pulled the image cards from a MongoDb database.
<li>Finally deployed the app using Firebase.
</ul><br><br>

<b>The Best features include:</b><br>
  <li>The swipable cards in the homepage.
  <li>The back and forth switching functionality.
  <li>The chats page where you can actually type your message and send it.<br>

<h1>You can check out the deployed version of my app over here --> https://tinder-clone-32963.web.app/ </h1>


<b>HAPPY CODING!!!</b>
