# Tinder-WebApp-Clone

1.This is a basic clone of the Tinder Application.
2.I've used Reactjs and Material-UI for the overall frontend.
3.I've pulled the image cards from a MongoDb database.
4.Finally deployed the app using Firebase.

The Best features include:
  1.The swipable cards in the homepage.
  2.The back and forth switching functionality.
  3.The chats page where you can actually type your message and send it.

You can check out the deployed version of my app over here --> https://tinder-clone-32963.web.app/


HAPPY CODING!!!
